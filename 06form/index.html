        <p><a href="inspiration.html#inspiration">What is rock climbing?</a><br> Rock climbing is a sport that has a <em>rich</em> and storied history, dating back to the early days of mountaineering. The earliest recorded instances of rock climbing can be traced back to China and Europe in the late 1800s, where mountaineers began to explore steep and challenging rock faces in an effort to summit peaks.</p>

            <p>There are so many types of climbing, but these are some of the most popular.

        <h3>Sport climbing</h3>
        <p>Unlike trad climbing, where a climber must place their own protection, sport climbing takes place on pre-bolted crags where the focus is more on the physicality of the climb than on self-sufficiency. A sport climber starts at the bottom of a route equipped with little more than a rope, harness, and quickdraws.As they move up the wall, they clip into fixed protection, usually bolts, which are somewhat evenly spaced to protect the climber throughout the route. Sport climbing is incredibly popular because it requires significantly less gear than traditional climbing, which makes it more accessible to the general public.</p>
